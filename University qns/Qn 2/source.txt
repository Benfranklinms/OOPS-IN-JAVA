FileInputStream: Used to read bytes from the source file.
FileOutputStream: Used to write bytes to the destination file.
The program reads each byte from the source file and writes it to the destination file until it reaches the end of the source file (i.e., -1).
In case of an error, the exception is caught, and a message is printed.
Streams are closed in the finally block to ensure they are closed even if an exception occurs.
